TryBAR
======

It's a rewrite of an [older TryBAR](https://github.com/piotrmaslanka/old-trybar) (written back in PHP)

It's basically a site being a catalog of bars. You can add them, make custom pages, rank them and display offers.

I basically made it for a friend, who did the graphics designs. I did the HTML cutting unfortunately :(

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.
